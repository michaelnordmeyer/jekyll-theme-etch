# jekyll-theme-etch
 
A Jekyll clone of the Hugo theme [Etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch) for benchmarking purposes done in [Benchmarking Hugo vs. Jekyll vs. Github Pages](https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/benchmarking-hugo-jekyll-github-pages).

As this theme was only created and used for this purpose, no further development will be done and the repository is therefore archived.
